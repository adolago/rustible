//! Enhanced diff module for Rustible
//!
//! This module provides advanced diff functionality including:
//! - Unified and side-by-side diff formats
//! - Colored terminal output
//! - Context-aware diffs
//! - Word-level diff highlighting
//! - Diff statistics
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use rustible::diff::{DiffFormatter, DiffFormat, DiffOptions};
//!
//! let formatter = DiffFormatter::new(DiffOptions::default());
//! let diff = formatter.format("old content", "new content");
//! println!("{}", diff);
//! ```

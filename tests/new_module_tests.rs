//! Unit tests for newly integrated modules (archive, uri, pause, wait_for)
//!
//! This file re-exports tests from the modules directory.
//! The actual tests are defined in tests/modules/*.rs files.

// Tests are included via tests/modules/mod.rs
// This file is kept for backwards compatibility but tests run via
// the main modules test configuration.

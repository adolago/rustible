    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA timing sidechannel (Marvin Attack)
    # Status: No fix available - the RSA crate has not released a fixed version
    # Risk: Medium severity (5.9) timing attack for key recovery
    # Mitigation: This is a transitive dependency via russh/ssh-key for SSH connectivity
    # The timing attack requires local access and precise timing measurements
    # We accept this risk as SSH is optional and the attack is difficult to execute
    "RUSTSEC-2023-0071",

    # RUSTSEC-2021-0145: atty - potential unaligned read (unsound)
    # Status: Transitive dependency through validator_derive if present
    # If atty appears it's from unmaintained dependencies
